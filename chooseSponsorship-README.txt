chooseSponsorship.tex is a sample letter to request reimbursement for
CHOOSE sponsorship to present a paper at a conference.

To request payment we need an invoice from the university (ask Iris) and we must enclose a copy of the lending contract with CHOOSE (so we do not pay MWSt).

Details can be found here:
