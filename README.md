# LatexTemplates

These are latex template used for papers and theses.

In addition there are:

- [macros.tex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scgbern/LatexTemplates/main/macros.tex) -- a collection of macros for highlighting reviewer comments and edits
- [st80.tex](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scgbern/LatexTemplates/main/st80.tex) -- macros for formatting Smalltalk code

*NB:* the macros in macros.tex are incorporated directly in the scg templates, but they can also be included separately in other templates.
